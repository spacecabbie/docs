# Import and export events

The Chamilo Agenda tool supports the import and export of standard calendar files \(Outlook, iCal\). To import an Outlook file, click the _Import Outlook_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics264%20%284%29.png) in the tool-bar in the course _Agenda_ and upload the relevant file as prompted. Then return to the _Agenda_ using the _Agenda_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics267%20%284%29.png).

Users can export events as iCal from the pop-up window that appears when they click on an event to view details. They can select the appropriate iCal format \(_confidential, private, public_\) for the export at the bottom of the pop-up window, and teachers can edit or delete the event using the appropriate button in the pop-up window:

\(**Note**: Teachers only have access to the delete/edit buttons via the course Agenda from the course homepage â€“ not via the Personal Agenda tab, where, like learners, they can only view/export events\).
