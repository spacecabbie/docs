# Adding an event to the course agenda

Events can be added to the course _Agenda_ in two ways. The simplest and quickest way is simply to click on the relevant date/day/time in the course _Agenda_ \(choose week or day view to select a specific time or timescale\). You can select users who can see the event, add a title and a brief verbal description, and decide whether to also send the event as an announcement/email:

For a more fully configured event entry, however, click the _Add event_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics262%20%283%29.png) in the tool-bar. This will open a dialogue page allowing entry of a title and the selection of users, but also a richer description \(e.g. using graphics\), automatic repeat configuration \(daily, weekly, monthly, yearly\) and the option to add an attachment \(to accompany email announcements\).
