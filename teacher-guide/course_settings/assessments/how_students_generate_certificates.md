# How students generate certificates

Certainly one of the trickiest aspects of certificates is that students **have to** enter the assessments tool to generate their certificate. When a student enters the assessments tool and a default certificate is configured, **and** the student has reached the minimum grade to get the certificate, he will see a large certificate icon on the right side of the screen. This will send him directly to the certificate page.

The certificate page uses a unique URL, so the student can just copy the link and reuse it later on, as long as the link is public, which is an option the administrator has to enable, like this:

Once generated, a certificate cannot be canceled by the student. The teacher has to enter the certificates management tool to remove it and allow the student to re-generate it.
