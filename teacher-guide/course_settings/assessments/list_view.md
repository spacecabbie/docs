# List view

The list view ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics201.png) view in the _Assessments_ tool allows you to list all learners and their results at any point through the course, as well as charts illustrating students' achievements overall for each assessment and a combined chart for all resources. \(This resource is obviously more useful at the end of a course – when students have completed all the assessed activities\). The view can be printed or exported in various formats \(.xml, .doc, .pdf, .csv\) using the relevant tool-bar icons.
