# Recording attendances

Having set up your course sessions, you'll need to start recording your learners' attendances. You do this using the _Attendances sheet,_ which you can access from the main _Attendances_ page by clicking on the relevant listing. You'll see a list of learners' names in the first column, then one column for each attendance date. Generally, the default column enabled will be the first one that hasn't been modified yet.

The _Attendance sheet_ displays a table with columns listing users, their attendance and dates/times. What dates you view is controlled by the _Filter_ drop down menu in the toolbar \(choose “all” and click _filter_ to see them all\). To enable editing of each date column, click the “padlock” ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics269.png) in the column heading.

By default, the system assumes all learners are attending the course session, so **only** take note of **missing** learners, by **unchecking** the learner's box to mark his absence.

A learner missing more than 10% of the total number of sessions will be marked by an orange background. A learner missing more than 25% of the sessions will be marked by a red background. \(These colourings are fixed parameters which cannot, at this point in time, be modified inside the platform.\)

An attendance sheet can be included in the assessments tool as a marked resource, to count towards a students overall grades for the course.
