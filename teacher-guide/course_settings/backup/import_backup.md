# Import backup

Each backup is a compressed file \(a Zip file\) which is stored on the server \(in the _archive/_ directory\). It can also be downloaded to your computer.

Chamilo also allows you to import the contents of a backup copy inside a new empty course. This can be useful for a teacher creating a new course.

To start the import:

* click the _Import backup_ link in the _Backup and import_ section![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics331.gif)
* choose the source of backup: either a .zip file on your computer or one stored on the server,
* choose whether you want to import the whole course or only specific sections \(to be selected in the next screen\),
* decide whether to duplicate specific files during the importation operation or to replace them,
* click _Import backup_ to start the import.
