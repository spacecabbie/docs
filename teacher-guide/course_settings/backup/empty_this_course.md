# Empty this course

The _Empty this course_ feature ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics334.gif) empties \(“recycles”\) either the whole course or selected elements. It deletes documents, forums, links, etc. This procedure can be executed after a course has ended and when you want to start anew in the same space. Of course, it is generally recommended that you keep a history of these courses.

Warning: Before you empty the course, make sure you take a backup copy, just in case!

To empty a course:

* click on the _Empty this course_ link,
* select whether you want to empty the whole course or just specific tools,
* click the _Empty this course_ button to proceed.

Click the _Delete the course area_ \_![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics335.gif)\_link to delete the course completely from the server.

Given the fact there's no way back from this, we highly recommend you consider this twice before confirming it.
