# Create a backup

For security and procedural reasons, it is recommended that you create a backup copy of the complete contents of your course. This procedure is automated. It allows you to create either a complete backup or a partial backup, based on your selection of what to save, using a few simple clicks. To begin backup:

* click on the _Create backup_ link in the _Backup and import_ section![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics330.gif),
* on the next page, select whether you want a full copy or just a selection of elements \(in which case you will have to select them on the next page and click _Validate_\),
* click the _Create backup_ button to launch the procedure.

The backup is made available in the form of a compressed file which you can download on your computer. It is also stored on the server for quick restoration if needed.
