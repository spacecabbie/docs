# Groups management

A teacher can manage groups in two ways – using the icons on the right of each listing in the main Groups page \(listed below\) to manage individual groups, and using the “batch management” feature \(tick boxes, buttons and drop-down lists\) displayed on the same page, which allows the teacher to apply the same functions to several or all groups at once. Using these methods together can save the teacher a lot of time consuming organization.
