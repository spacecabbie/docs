# Fill a group manually

For a variety of reasons, a teacher may want to select group members manually, i.e. choose which learners will work together, e.g. learners with similar interests or goal, or an experienced learner with a latecomer to the course. To do this, \(whether or not the groups have already been auto-filled\) click the _Edit this group_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics285.png) to add users manually:

Select and add/remove users as required using the arrows. Any user can be added as a _coach_ \(i.e. group leader, tutor etc.\) or as a _Group member –_ this will be shown in the listing.
