# Overview /Export of group members

A teacher can quickly view a list of group members by clicking on the _Groups overview_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics286%20%283%29.png) on the main Groups page. From here, you can use the export feature, which is described more fully in the chapter dedicated to the _Users_ tool. Just click on the _Excel export_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics288%20%283%29.png) then open or save the file on your computer.
