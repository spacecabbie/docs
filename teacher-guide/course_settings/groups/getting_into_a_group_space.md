# Getting into a group space

Group members can access the group's “workspace” simply by clicking the name of the relevant group in the listing on the main _Groups_ page. The page will display the group description \(e.g. a list of aims and objectives\) and details of membership, as well as it's own “toolbar” of links to the group's various tools \(_Forums, Documents, Agenda, Assignments, Announcements, Wiki_ and _chat\)_ which link to the various \(private\) group workspaces:

From the group space, you can query a learner's information sheet by simply clicking on her name in the list of members in the lower part of the page.
