# Chat

The _Chat_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics374.png) is an instant messaging tool which allows users in a course to exchange ideas, questions and answers in “live”, written conversation.

While it may seem rather slow \(three seconds per post\) and limited in features to todays online users, the big advantage of this tool compared to e.g. _Skype, Facebook_ chat tools is it works as part of the platform and, as such, does not require any external tool, being guaranteed to work on all computers with the capability to use Chamilo.

If users have configured their picture in the _Social network_ \(or _Profile_\) tab, it will appear next to their name. It's up to the teacher to delete previous messages when he considers it necessary.
