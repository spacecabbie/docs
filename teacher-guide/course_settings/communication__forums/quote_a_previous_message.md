# Quote a previous message

Inside a thread, within a forum, it is often most practical to be able to quote a whole or part of a message. This is the aim of this operation, triggered by the double quote icon. The ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images90%20%283%29.png) answer will be accompanied by the related message to which it is making reference \(it will appear in another color in your answer\). You can compose a comment etc. as well as edit the quoted text directly.
