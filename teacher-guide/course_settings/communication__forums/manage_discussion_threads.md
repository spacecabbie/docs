# Manage discussion threads

The day-to-day administration of topics \(also referred to as “discussion threads”\) is identical to that of categories or forums. You may, however, move a topic from one forum to another better suited,one.

| Icons | Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images75%20%283%29.png) | Change the settings \(name, message and advanced settings: see previous page\) of the topic |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images76%20%284%29.png) | Delete \(after approval\) the topic and all the messages it contained |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images77%20%284%29.png) | Control the visibility of a topic |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images78%20%283%29.png) | Lock / unlock a topic to forbid its modification \(but its reading will still be authorized\) |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics129%20%284%29.png) | Move a topic to another forum |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images80%20%285%29.png) | Ask to be sent a notification by e-mail when a new answer is added |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/images81%20%285%29.png) | Visualize the topic's participants and score their contributions if the topic has been marked as scored |

Moving a topic from one forum to another has to be done through a drop-down list. Select within that list the destination forum, then click on the “Move Thread” button to proceed. The effect is immediate.
