# Prerequisites

If a learning path contains several elements, it is possible to establish the completion of tasks and targets expected of learners following the learning path using the _prerequisites_ feature.

Click on the _prerequisites_ button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics46.png) next to any element in the path \(or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics41.png) in edit view\):

This allows the teacher to require the learner to have completed another task in the learning path \(e.g. the preceding task\) before they can access this element, and also, e.g. in the case of a test or assessment, to have achieved a given minimum score.

Using the _prerequisite options_ button in the toolbar, prerequisites to complete the preceding step can be set globally for all steps in the path, or alternatively all prerequisites can be cleared from the path.
