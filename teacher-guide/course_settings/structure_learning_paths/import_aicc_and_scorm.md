# Import AICC and SCORM

Chamilo uses standards like [SCORM](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) and [AICC](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Industry_CBT_Committee) for the exchange of contents. Importing such files couldn't be easier. Click the Learning Path icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics34.png)on the _Learning paths_ page:

Click _choose file to_ select the relevant document on your hard disk and _send_ to upload it. That's it. Your imported course is ready to use.

> **Note** : Chamilo 1.8 and all its derivations \(including D0keos\) only support SCORM in version 1.2.
