# Notebook

The _Personal notes_ \(or _Notebook_\) tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics303.png) is a kind of notepad attached to each course. It allows the users to take note of things they would otherwise write on a piece of paper.

Notes can be updated as needed and dates of creation and latest update are saved. Notes taken by a user are not visible by other users. In this sense, they are, indeed, personal.
