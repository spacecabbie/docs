# Add a new linked page

From the page you're going to add the link to:

* click the _Edit this page_ icon,
* click the line you want to add the link on, then **either**:
* add the text between double square brackets \[\[_link to the page to be created_\]\]. Once saved, the text entered between brackets will be transformed into a link to a new empty page
