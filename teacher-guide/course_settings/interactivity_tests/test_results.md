Here, the teacher can get an overview of learners' times and scores, and can score ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics160.png) or edit ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics163.png) open questions and offer feedback. He can also delete ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics164.png) a test attempt to allow the learner to do the test again \(if there is a valid reason to do so e.g. there was an error in the test\).

The menu bar of this page allows the teacher to navigate back ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics165.png) to the test , export test results in CSV or XLS format ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics166.png) \(e.g. to sort them and generate graphical evaluation statistics\), view statistics ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics169.png) about test questions undertaken or even monitor students taking the test “live” ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics168.png)to know how they are performing “during” the exam \(particularly useful to monitored exam centers\).
