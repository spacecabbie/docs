# Creating a new test

Creating a new test is very easy. Click the _create a test_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics130.png) on the left and give your test a title, then click on the _proceed to questions_ button.

If you opt to _give a context to the test_ \_![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics131.png)\_you can use the on-line editor to compose an explanatory section which will be visible to learners when they undertake the test.

The test will be displayed on the main page of the test tool, listed along with other tests created in the course:

Because there are so many different ways the test tool can be used, there is a good chance the default options are not entirely suitable your needs. Be careful, therefore to consider the extensive Advanced _settings_ section available in the _create/edit test_ page:

The settings are fairly self evident:

* feedback can be provided either at the end of the test or withheld, e.g. for an exam
* questions can be presented either on a single page \(e.g. for a brief text quiz\) or on separate pages \(e.g. when the question and answers are lengthy or incorporate media\)
* scores and correct answers can be shown \(e.g. for an interactive exercise\) or hidden \(e.g. for an exam\).
* Questions and answers can follow a pre-determined sequence or be randomized and shuffled
* The relevant questions category can be displayed or hidden
* The number of attempts allowed can be limited to a given number - “infinite” attempts might suit a “practice” exercise
* Start and end times for the test can be set and the time allowed to complete the test can be limited; \)a real-time counter will appear to the user\)
* Negative scores can be “zeroed” or carried forward to the next question
* Students can review their answers before submitting the test
* A pass percentage can be set to indicate success or failure to the student
* A closing message to be viewed on completion can be composed.

> **Note** : _The platform administrator may enable an additional option in the “Feedback” section of the advanced settings:\_\_Self-evaluation \(immediate feedback\)._ This option, if checked, enables the “scenario” question types which allows teachers to devise quizzes based on multiple-choice or image mapping questions which, depending on the answer given, lead the learner to alternative subsequent questions. This is a powerful tool – however, be aware that once _self-evaluation_ is checked, these advanced settings cannot be changed: you will instead have to create a new test not based on the _Self-evaluation \(immediate feedback\)_ option.
