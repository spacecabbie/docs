# Folders

The teacher can add folders to categorize his files a bit more clearly. The shared folders \(be they sent or received\) are invisible to learners and are only there for organizational purposes.

To create a new folder, click on the _Add a new folder_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics254%20%283%29.png), enter a name for it in the field that appears at the top of the screen and click the _Create category_ button.
