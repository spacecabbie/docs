# Interaction tools

The objective of the interaction section is to group tools which facilitate communication between learners as well as between learner and teacher. Unlike the _Authoring_ tools which are primarily for teacher use, The _Interaction_ tools are provided mainly for use by other users also, to support their learning.

## Users <a id="users"></a>

## Chat <a id="chat"></a>

## Surveys <a id="surveys"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics104.png) The fully featured survey tool a powerful means of inviting users on the platform to quickly and easily offer comment and feedback for the evaluation and development of courses. The tool also supports the analysis of results collected from participants.

## Notebook <a id="notebook"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics105.png) Sometimes a learner or teacher just wants to keep personal notes relevant to his or coursework. The notebook tool provides a simple means for users to write and store and organize such notes within the platform for their own use, using the on-line editor. Notes created by this tool are private: no user has access to the notes of another user.

## Video-conference <a id="video-conference"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics106.png) It is now relatively easy, using a local video-conference server, to install the video-conference tool within a Chamilo course, although it remains an external extension which is not always available in a classic portal. Chamilo 1.9 supports BigBlueButton 0.8, open-source conferencing software which supports recording of the white board and audio from a conference. The video sessions can later be made available within Chamilo itself as a video library inside the course. From a teacher's point of view, it's worth lobbying your administrator to set it up!
