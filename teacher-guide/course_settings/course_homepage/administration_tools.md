# Administration tools

The _administration_ section groups tools that the learner never needs access to – there is therefore no option to hide or show the tools, which are designed for teacher use only.

## Projects <a id="projects"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics107.png) This is where the teacher can create new _blogs_ visible and available to learners in the _Authoring_ section. A blog integrates tasks and users management via a calendar within the _Blogs_ tool, supporting the effective management of collaborative projects.

## Settings <a id="settings"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics108.png) Manage the course settings as a teacher. Settings are sorted in a few sections:

## Reporting <a id="reporting"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics113.png) This important teacher tool tracks learners' use of learning paths, tests, forums etc., as well as time spent on the course, progress, scores, assignments, numbers of messages and last connection date. It is a powerful monitoring tool which can save the teacher a huge amount of time and dreary record keeping work.

## Backup <a id="backup"></a>

![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics346%20%281%29.png) This is where you can \(and regularly should!\) back up your course by exporting a copy of the course. You can also use it to import previously backed up courses and to delete all or part of the course content and data. You can also use it simply to delete the course – be careful, though – there's no way back!
