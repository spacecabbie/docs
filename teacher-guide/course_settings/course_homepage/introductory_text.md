# Introductory text

Just before looking at any particular course tool, note that it is possible to present a welcome message to a course. Click on the _Add an_ _introduction text_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics349.gif) below the _Learner View_ button. A text editor appears...

This feature, although very simple to use, is also very powerful: it can simply present a few words of introduction, but it also enables you to redesign the entire course homepage simply by hiding all the course tools and writing a large introduction text/page including icons with links to the course tools' internal pages.

To do this :

* hide all the tools \(by clicking the eye, which must be _closed_ and grayed\)
* right-click on any tool to which the learners need access
* select _Copy link location_
* left-click on _Add an introduction text_
* place an introduction text \(use the table tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics81.png), or an external HTML-editing tool if you wish, to position elements precisely\) and a new icon/graphic representing the tool requiring access
* click an icon to select it then click the link creation tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics82.png)
* « paste » the link that was saved a few steps before \(CTRL-V should work just fine\)
* click the _save intro text_ button

You now have an entirely personalized course homepage! The only remaining other visual elements are the header and the footer.
