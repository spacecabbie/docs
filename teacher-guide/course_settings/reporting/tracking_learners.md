# Tracking learners

By default, clicking on the _Reporting_ icon will display summary details for a list of learners on the course. It includes summary information about test scores, time spent on-line, login details etc.

On this page the teacher, as well as viewing a summary table of students' overall activity and progress, can easily add columns to the table drawing on students' profile information \(country, date of birth\) as well as data held elsewhere in the course \(course code, performance data, assignments, messages, surveys\). He/she can highlight ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics47.gif)learners absent from the course for a specified length of time and at one click notify learners with an appropriate announcement using a configurable announcement tool \(see chapter 21\) accessed by clicking the notify button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics50.png) . The teacher can also print out the table ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics49.png) or export it as a csv file ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics52.png).
