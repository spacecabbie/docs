# Setting up the assignment evaluation

The teacher's evaluation of student assignments can be automatically included within the assessments tool. The marks assigned to corrected assignments will form part of the overall assessment, and a weighting assigned for each particular assignment.

To include assignments' evaluation in the assessments:

* click on the _Advanced settings_ link in the Create/edit _assignment_ page
* assign a _Maximum score_ greater than 0
* check the _Add to grade-book_ box
* choose the relevant assessment from the drop-down list
* assign a weighting within the assessment
* click on the _Validate_ button.
