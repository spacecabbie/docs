# Marking assignments

To mark a document uploaded by a learner, go to the main page for the relevant assignment. In the right hand column headed _Detail_, click on the _Save_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics75.png)to download and view a file the student has submitted, then click the _Correct and rate_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics76.png) to add feedback/comments and a score. If the student has not uploaded a file, but submitted their assignment using the on-line editor, the save icon will not show â€“ instead the student's assignment will be automatically shown in the editor to which the teacher can add feedback etc when scoring the work.
