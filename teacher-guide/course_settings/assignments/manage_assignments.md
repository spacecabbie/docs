# Manage assignments

If the number of learners in your course is significant, there will be plenty of assignments to mark..!

Chamilo eases the burden a little by keeping an organized record of assignments set and student posts on the main page for each assignment set. It lists the assignments completed by learners as each is submitted, flags up clearly if they need to be marked, offers a record of dates , allows quick navigation to each assignment exercise for review and displays each learner's scores. Clicking on the column headings allows for the quick and easy re-ordering of entries e.g. according to date, students name, score etc. The toolbar includes listings ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics69.png) for “missing” submissions from students on the course \(including an option to send a reminder\), and the list can be downloaded as a .zip file.
