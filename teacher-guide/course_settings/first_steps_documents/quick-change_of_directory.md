# Quick-change of directory

When creating a new course with example content, the _Documents_ tool contains several directories \(_audio, flash, images,_ etc\) by default.

These directories are meant to provide additional help organizing resources inside the course. Once there are over twenty or so documents in the root directory, it becomes difficult to locate a document when needed, because you will have to scroll up and down to get to see all the files. Because of this, we recommend not having more than twenty files in a single directory - general good practice in file management anyway.

These directories are by default invisible to learners. It is up to the teacher to decide whether learners should see these directories' contents or not \(by clicking on the _eye_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics115.png)\).

Of course, it is possible to create several other directories using the folder creation icon. In order to navigate swiftly within the directories tree, a drop-down list called _Current folder_ is available on the top left of the screen allowing any level of documents-directory to be readily accessed.

Once inside a directory, the _“up a level”_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics117.png) lets the teacher get back up one directory level.
