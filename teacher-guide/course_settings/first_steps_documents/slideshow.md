# Slideshow

If you have a lot of images uploaded in your folders and want to see them all at once, you can use the slideshow feature. Click on the slideshow icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics126.png) to go to the folder where your images are located.

You'll be presented with a type of “slideshow” view of the images in that folder. Each image is captioned with its name, dimensions and size on disk.

It may be more practical to select the small _show thumbnails_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics127.png) in the slideshow toolbar to let you view all images at once \(as thumbnails\), as illustrated below:

A _settings_ option![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics345.png) is available to further fine-tune the viewing of images.
