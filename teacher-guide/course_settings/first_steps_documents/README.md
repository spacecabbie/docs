# First Steps: Documents

The normal first step any teacher takes when needing content for a course is to go to the _Documents_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics111.png) and upload existing content \(in the form of PDFs, PowerPoints, etc\).

Chamilo allows for the import of all types of documents \(HTML, MS-Word®, MS-PowerPoint® MS-Excel®, PDF, Flash, Quicktime®, OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice, MP3, OGG, AVI, etc.\) and can first be used as a simple documents catalog while the teacher builds up a bank of materials \(a few weeks, depending on the context\).

You can rename documents at any time and arrange them in directories/folders. The only provision is that the user must, of course, have the requisite software installed on his computer to read the files at his disposal. We recommend the use of standard and open formats \(see note below\) to avoid the need for the learner to download or buy costly software which might be overly specific \(i.e. with no other use\) or prove difficult to maintain.

With regard to file storage, you do need to be sure to organize the _Documents_ tool carefully to make it easy to find a document later on.

Note : The Chamilo community strives for a complete freedom in the distribution of \(distance\) learning material. From this perspective that a high priority is given to the support of open formats and applications, like LibreOffice® and its OASIS format rather than the Microsoft® Office® suite;OGG \(and its variations\) rather than MP3® or DivX®; etc. So we'd like to remind you that all features of Chamilo can be used with a simple, open spec. browser, the only exception to which is the video-conference and the hot spot exercises, which require the Flash® plug-in \(which is free but not open\). We are working on this last element to increase the availability of this type of exercise to devices that do not support Flash®.
