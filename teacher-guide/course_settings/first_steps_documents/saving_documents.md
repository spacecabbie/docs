# Saving documents

Chamilo allows you to save all the documents, or a specific directory, simply by clicking on the _Save \(ZIP\)_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics120.png) in the toolbar at the top of the page.

It is also possible to save a single file by clicking on the _download_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics123.png) to the right of the filename, or to download a specific directory by clicking on the _Save \(ZIP\)_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics121.png) to the right of the directory listing. The briefcase icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics124.png) allows users to copy a shared file into their private file area in the _social networks_ area \(see chapter 35\).
