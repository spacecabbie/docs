# Configuration File

The core configuration file is:

`app/config/configuration.php`

This file contains a list of variables that can be modified by the campus site's server administrator. Pay attention when changing these variables, some changes may cause Chamilo to stop working. If you changed some settings and want to restore them, please have a look at configuration.dist.php. that file is an exact copy of the config file at install time.
