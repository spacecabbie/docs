# Participating to the development

If you have the capabilities to contribute patches and new code to Chamilo, we're happy to help you get started. We understanding the task might feel daunting at first.

A good place to start might be with github issues, called "[Good first contrib](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/labels/Good%20first%20contrib)". Issues marked with this tag are usually a question of less than 1h work for an experienced Chamilo developer, and should be good practice for developers starting with Chamilo.
